So far you've directed agents through chat. But a lot of work doesn't live in a conversation — it lives on a board, in a document, or on a checklist. **Canvases** give you and the agent a shared surface for exactly that kind of work, right inside the app. In this lesson you'll first use a canvas included with Tailspin Toys, then create one for the backlog you've been working through.

In this lesson, you will:

- understand what a canvas is and when to use one.
- use the existing Database Explorer canvas to inspect project data.
- create a shared Kanban board canvas to triage your backlog.
- inspect and exercise the new canvas without implementing another feature.

## Scenario

Tailspin Toys already includes a canvas for exploring its database. After using it to understand how a canvas turns project data into an interactive surface, you'll create a reusable board for choosing what to work on next without starting another feature.

## What is a canvas?

A [canvas][canvas-docs] is a shared, interactive surface for a work artifact — a plan, a triage board, a release checklist, a dashboard, or a document. While chat is useful for describing intent and reasoning through ambiguity, most work happens on a *surface*. Canvases let you collaborate with the agent directly on that surface.

Canvases are **bidirectional**: the agent can update the canvas while it works, and you can edit the same surface yourself. When you create a canvas, the agent builds it based on your prompt and workflow, and you can ask it to add, remove, or revise capabilities as you go. Once created, a canvas opens in the app's right side panel.

Some common examples include:

- **Markdown canvases** for planning your day and prioritizing issues and pull requests.
- **Agentic Kanban boards** where people and agents add cards and move work across columns.
- **Issue triage boards** that summarize top issues and recurring themes for a repository.

## Why use a canvas?

Reach for a canvas when a task needs structure, iteration, and verification, and a chat alone isn't enough. A canvas lets you:

- ground the agent's work in an actual artifact that fits your workflow.
- steer or correct work directly on the shared surface, then let the agent continue from your changes.
- inspect progress as visible changes to an artifact, not just chat responses.

## Use the Database Explorer canvas

Start with the project's existing Database Explorer canvas. Using a working example lets you see how a repository-scoped canvas behaves before you create one yourself.

1. Confirm the filtering pull request (PR) is merged and update your local `main`.
2. Return to the GitHub Copilot app and select the **Home screen**.
3. Confirm `tailspin-toys` is the selected repository.
4. Create a session in a **new working tree** based on the updated `main`, then select **Interactive** mode.
5. Ask Copilot to prepare the local database if needed and open the existing canvas without changing it:

    ```plaintext
    Set up the local database if needed, then open the repository's Database Explorer canvas. Do not change any files.
    ```

6. In the Database Explorer, browse the available tables and select `games`.
7. Run a read-only query that shows five highly rated games:

    ```sql
    SELECT title, star_rating
    FROM games
    ORDER BY star_rating DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

8. Confirm the results contain no more than five games in descending rating order.
9. Open **Files** and inspect `.github/extensions/database-explorer/extension.mjs`. Note how the canvas is stored with the project and restricts queries to read-only `SELECT` and `WITH` statements.
10. Confirm the session has no file changes.

## Create a canvas to triage issues

Now create a different kind of shared surface. Saving the triage canvas at project scope makes it a repository asset that the team can review and reuse.

1. In the same session, enter `/create-canvas`, then describe the canvas you want to create:

   ```plaintext
   Create a Kanban triage canvas for this repo's open issues and save it under .github/extensions/. Highlight the three issues you'd prioritize and explain why, with the rest below. Include summaries and links.

   Give each card an "Add to current context" action that adds the issue details without starting work or changing the issue. Make it keyboard-accessible and open it so I can try it.
   ```

Copilot creates the canvas extension under `.github/extensions` and opens the shared surface in the app's right side panel. The generated extension is executable repository content, not just a visual artifact, so you'll inspect its files and behavior next.

## Inspect and exercise the canvas

Before sharing the canvas, compare it with the repository's actual issues and exercise its controls. This confirms that its content is accurate, its interaction is accessible, and its issue action adds context without starting work.

1. Open **Changes** and confirm the canvas definition is repository-backed under `.github/extensions/`, not saved only for your user or session. Check that existing extensions and application files are unchanged.
2. Compare the board with the actual open issues and assess the ranking explanations.
3. Check that cards and controls are readable and usable with a keyboard.
4. Select **Add to current context** for an issue and confirm only its details enter the conversation. No implementation or issue-state change should start.
5. Review any corrections and ask Copilot to run the applicable existing validation for the files changed. Record results and blockers, rather than assuming an interactive surface is correct because it opened.
6. If the canvas needs changes, request focused improvements within the triage scope, then repeat the affected checks. Do not implement one of the backlog issues as part of this canvas work.

The workshop stops before creating another PR because you've already practiced both manual merging and Agent Merge. In production, review and merge the canvas through your team's normal process before others rely on it.

## Summary and next steps

You created and reused a shared surface where you and the agent can collaborate. In this lesson, you:

- understood what a canvas is and when to use one.
- used the existing Database Explorer canvas to inspect project data.
- created a shared Kanban board canvas to triage your backlog.
- inspected and exercised the new canvas without implementing another feature.

With your backlog tracked, you'll [review everything you've built and explore where to go next][next-lesson].
