Keep the backlog and the implementation loop in the terminal, and open separate sessions for independent work.

In this lesson, you will:

- create three focused GitHub issues.
- add an issue to the chat from the side panel and implement it.
- review the change with `/diff`.
- start a second session in an isolated worktree.

## Create a backlog

Send the following prompt:

```plaintext
Review the space quiz and create three focused GitHub issues with clear titles, user-focused descriptions, and acceptance criteria. Do not implement them yet.
```

## Work the first issue in this session

1. Press the <kbd>Left arrow</kbd> key to open the side panel, then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move across to the **Issues** tab.
2. Highlight the first issue and press <kbd>c</kbd> to add it to the chat as context. To read the full issue first, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> instead.
3. Ask the agent to implement the issue.

The side panel lists every tab across the top, and the hints along the bottom are the keys that act on whatever is highlighted.

## Review the change with `/diff`

The project is published, so there is a known-good version to compare against. `/diff` shows precisely what this issue changed on top of it, which is exactly what you are about to ask someone to review.

1. Run `/diff` and read every changed file.
2. Ask for a fix for anything that looks wrong, then run `/diff` again.
3. Run `!git status` or `!git diff` whenever you want to inspect Git directly.

## Work the second issue in parallel

1. Open the side panel again and switch to the **Sessions** tab.
2. Start another session for the second issue without losing the first one.
3. In the new session, run `/worktree` so it gets an isolated worktree instead of branching in place. Both sessions can now run at once without interfering with each other.
4. Add the second issue to that session with <kbd>c</kbd>.
5. Leave the session there for now. The next lesson plans this issue before any code is written.

![Illustration of Copilot CLI output after running /worktree. It reports that it created the worktree ../space-quiz-13 on the branch issue-13-review-screen, and that this session now works there while main is untouched.](../../_images/first-steps-cli-worktree.svg)

`/worktree` moves the session into its own checkout on its own branch, so the first session keeps working undisturbed.

## Summary and next steps

You implemented the first issue, reviewed it with `/diff`, and started a second session in its own worktree. Continue to [Lesson 5: Plan before you edit][next-lesson].
