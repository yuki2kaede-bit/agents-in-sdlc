Terminal commands make context visible and intentional. Knowing what the agent can see helps you understand its results and decide when to start fresh.

In this lesson, you will:

- inspect the context window with `/context`.
- see how much of the window each part consumes.
- reset a drifting conversation with `/clear`.

## Inspect the context

1. Run `/context` to inspect files, instructions, and conversation history.
2. Check how much of the window each part is consuming.
3. Run `/clear` to start fresh when the conversation has drifted.
4. Add the right file back before you ask for another change.

`/context` shows exactly what is filling the context window and how much room is left. When you are running low, use `/compact` to summarize the conversation, or start a fresh session.

## Summary and next steps

You can now see and manage what the agent knows. Continue to [Lesson 7: Resume and go remote][next-lesson].
