Finish the development loop without switching to a desktop UI.

In this lesson, you will:

- inspect the changed files one last time.
- create a pull request from the current branch.
- review the pull request and address feedback.
- validate and merge the pull request with `/pr agentmerge`.

## Create, review, and merge

1. Run `/diff` to inspect the changed files one last time.
2. Ask Copilot to create a pull request from the current branch, or run `/pr create`.
3. Open the side panel's **Pull requests** tab to check the title, description, files, and status checks.
4. Fix actionable feedback, check the result in the browser, and reply with what changed.
5. When the pull request is ready, run `/pr agentmerge` to validate it and merge it after the required confirmations and checks pass.

## Summary and next steps

You created, reviewed, and merged a pull request without leaving the terminal. Continue to [Lesson 9: Delegate work once you trust the loop][next-lesson].
