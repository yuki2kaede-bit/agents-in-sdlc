Take a beginner-friendly, hands-on tour of GitHub Copilot CLI. You will build a colorful Space Quiz from an empty folder and learn the terminal-first loop: build and review diffs before Git writes anything, run sessions side by side, plan before you edit, then create and merge the pull request without leaving your shell.

The workshop takes approximately 60 to 90 minutes. Your project uses a single HTML file with no runtime dependencies, so you can focus on learning the CLI and its agentic workflows.
