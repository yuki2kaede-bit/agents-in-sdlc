You completed the terminal-first loop: you built the quiz, reviewed diffs, published, ran sessions in parallel, planned before editing, resumed sessions, merged a pull request, and delegated new work without leaving the terminal.

## What you completed

You:

- installed Copilot CLI and chose a model with `/model`.
- built and refined a quiz from a single prompt.
- captured project rules with `/init`.
- published the project by prompt or by hand.
- added an issue to the chat from the side panel and reviewed the change with `/diff`.
- ran a second session in its own worktree with `/worktree`.
- planned the second issue with `/plan` before any code changed.
- inspected and managed context with `/context` and `/clear`.
- resumed sessions with `copilot --resume` and `/resume`.
- created and merged a pull request with `/pr create` and `/pr agentmerge`.
- delegated a new feature with `/delegate`.
