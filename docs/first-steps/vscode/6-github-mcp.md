Enable the GitHub MCP server *before* you ask Copilot to create issues or work with pull requests. With these tools, Copilot can read and write GitHub data directly from chat.

In this lesson, you will:

- enable the GitHub MCP server.
- review the tools and permissions the server requests.
- confirm that the GitHub tools are available in chat.

## Enable GitHub MCP

1. Open VS Code **Settings** and enable the built-in **GitHub MCP** server, if your version includes it.
2. Otherwise, install a trusted GitHub MCP server through the [MCP server configuration flow][mcp-servers].
3. Review the tools and permissions the server requests before you approve it.
4. Confirm that the GitHub tools appear in the Copilot Chat tools picker.

## Summary and next steps

Copilot now has GitHub-aware tools. Continue to [Lesson 7: Plan and implement issues][next-lesson].
