Plan mode researches the workspace and writes an implementation plan without touching your files.

In this lesson, you will:

- switch Copilot Chat from Agent to Plan.
- review and refine a proposed plan.
- switch back to Agent to implement the plan.

## Agree on the approach before any edits

1. Open Copilot Chat and use the **mode dropdown** above the input.
2. Switch from **Agent** to **Plan**.
3. Describe the next feature with the following prompt and let Copilot investigate the workspace:

   ```plaintext
   Plan how to add a review screen that shows every question with the answer I chose. Investigate the existing quiz, list the changes you would make, call out accessibility and single-file risks, and stop before editing.
   ```

4. Read the plan and request changes, then switch back to **Agent** to implement it.

> [!TIP]
> **When plan mode pays off**
>
> Use Plan mode for anything ambiguous, cross-cutting, or expensive to undo. The cheapest place to fix a bad approach is before the first edit.

## Summary and next steps

You agreed on an approach with Copilot before it wrote any code. Continue to [Lesson 6: Give Copilot GitHub-aware tools][next-lesson].
