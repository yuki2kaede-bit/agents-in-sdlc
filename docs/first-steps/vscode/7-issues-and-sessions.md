With GitHub MCP enabled, Copilot can create and read issues directly from chat.

In this lesson, you will:

- create three focused GitHub issues from Copilot Chat.
- start a new chat session for one issue.
- implement and verify the issue.

## Create issues

Send the following prompt:

```plaintext
Review the space quiz and suggest three focused feature ideas. Use the GitHub tools to create a separate issue for each with a clear title, user-focused description, and acceptance criteria. Do not implement them yet.
```

## Implement one issue

1. Open the **GitHub** view in the Activity Bar and inspect the new issues.
2. Choose one issue, then select the **+** button in Copilot Chat to start a new session for it.
3. Use Agent mode to implement the issue while the original session stays available for comparison.
4. Run the integrated-browser smoke test from [Lesson 3][lesson-3] before you create a pull request.

## Summary and next steps

You created issues and implemented one in its own session. Continue to [Lesson 8: Review and merge][next-lesson].
