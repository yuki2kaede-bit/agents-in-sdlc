Ask the agent to suggest focused product improvements, turn those ideas into GitHub issues, and implement one issue in an isolated session.

In this lesson, you will:

- create three focused issues for the Space Quiz.
- browse the issues in **My work**.
- start a session from an issue in a new worktree.
- review the diff in the **Changes** tab and verify the feature.

## Build a backlog in My work

Send the following prompt:

```plaintext
Review the space quiz and suggest three focused feature ideas that could each be completed in a short session. Create a separate GitHub issue for each idea with a clear title, user-focused description, and acceptance criteria. Do not implement them yet.
```

Open **My work**, review the three issues, and choose one that has clear value and a manageable scope.

**My work** pulls your GitHub issues and pull requests into the app, filtered by **All**, **Active**, **Review requests**, and **Done**.

## Implement an issue

1. Open the selected issue in **My work**.
2. Select **New session**.
3. Choose a **new worktree** when prompted.
4. Use **Interactive** mode and your preferred model.
5. Send the following prompt:

   ```plaintext
   Implement this issue completely. Keep the single-file, dependency-free design, test the behavior in the integrated browser, and summarize the changes when finished.
   ```

The new worktree keeps this feature isolated from your default branch until you are ready to review and merge it.

## Review the diff yourself

When the agent reports back, do not take its word for it.

1. Open the right-side flyout and select the **Changes** tab.
2. Read the diff for every file the session touched.
3. Test the feature in the integrated browser and confirm that it meets the issue's acceptance criteria.

![Illustration of the Copilot app session with the Changes tab open in the right-side flyout. It shows one file changed, index.html, with 142 lines added and 8 removed, and inline diff lines beside the session conversation.](../../_images/first-steps-app-changes-tab.svg)

The **Changes** tab lists every file the session touched, with the diff inline.

## Summary and next steps

You created a backlog, implemented one issue in an isolated session, and reviewed the diff. Continue to [Lesson 7: Plan before you edit][next-lesson].
