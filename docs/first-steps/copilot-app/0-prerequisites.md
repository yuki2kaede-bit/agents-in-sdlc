Before you build the Space Quiz, confirm that you have what you need, install the GitHub Copilot app, and get familiar with its workspace.

In this lesson, you will:

- verify the workshop prerequisites.
- install and sign in to the GitHub Copilot app.
- choose a model for your sessions.
- identify the app's primary work areas.
- try a quick chat.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- a GitHub account with a [Copilot plan][copilot-plans].
- a computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux.

The app ships with Git, so there is nothing else to install.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise, your administrator must enable the **Copilot CLI** policy before agent sessions will work.

## Install and configure the app

1. Download and install the [GitHub Copilot app][download-app] for your operating system.
2. Open the app.
3. Select **Sign in to GitHub** and authenticate.
4. Choose a theme, then select **Finish**.

## Choose a model

Use the following preference order when you choose a model, and select the first option available to you:

1. **GPT-6-Luna** (recommended).
2. **Auto**, as a balanced backup.
3. Any model from the [list of active models][active-models].

Model availability depends on your plan, organization policy, and product version.

## Find your way around

The app brings the development workflow into one place:

- **New**: Start a session on a project, or choose **Chat** for a quick question.
- **My work**: Browse your GitHub issues and pull requests.
- **Automations**: Schedule recurring agent work on a repository.
- **Customize**: Change themes and models, and manage Canvas extensions.

## Try a quick chat

Not every question needs a workspace. From **New**, choose **Chat** instead of a project. A chat has no repository attached and cannot edit files, so it is the fastest way to ask a question, get an explanation, or think through an approach before you start a real session.

Send the following prompt in a chat:

```plaintext
How does the GitHub Copilot app use worktrees?
```

## Summary and next steps

You verified the prerequisites, installed the app, chose a model, and explored its main work areas. Continue to [Lesson 1: Create the Space Quiz workspace][next-lesson].
