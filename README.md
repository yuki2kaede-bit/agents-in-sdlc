# Copilot Workshops — Workshop Content

Workshop content for **Copilot Workshops**, with guided first-step experiences and real-world development scenarios across Copilot CLI, VS Code agent mode, the GitHub Copilot app, and the Copilot cloud agent.

The published site lives at **<https://github-samples.github.io/copilot-workshops/>**.

> [!NOTE]
> The real-world development workshops use Tailspin Toys, a pure-Astro crowdfunding site (SSR, API endpoints, and a Drizzle data layer) that lives in a separate repository: **<https://github.com/github-samples/tailspin-toys>**. First steps workshops may guide learners in creating a small project from scratch. This repository holds only the workshop content: lesson Markdown, images, and the Astro + Starlight site that publishes them.

## Start the workshop

Visit the published site: <https://github-samples.github.io/copilot-workshops/>.

## Authoring

If you want to add or edit content, start with **[AUTHORING.md](./AUTHORING.md)**. It has the mental model, file map, and step-by-step recipes for adding lessons and images.

## Repository structure

- **`docs/`** — **Lesson source (plain Markdown). Edit here.** Browsable directly on github.com, no build required.
  - `README.md` — Workshop landing page (also the published site's home via `slug: index`).
  - `first-steps/` — Guided introductory workshops for the GitHub Copilot app, GitHub Copilot CLI, and VS Code, adapted from James Montemagno's [First Steps with GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/first-steps-with-github-copilot) (MIT).
  - `real-world-development/` — Scenario-based workshops organized by environment: `cli/`, `vscode/`, `cloud/`, and `app/`.
  - `es-es/`, `ja-jp/`, `ko-kr/`, `pt-br/`, `zh-cn/` — Translated locale trees that mirror available English category and workshop paths.
  - `_images/` — Screenshots and diagrams (shared across all locales).
- **`website/`** — Optional Astro + Starlight site that publishes `docs/` to GitHub Pages. Only needed to self-host or preview the rendered site.
  - `astro.config.mjs` — Site URL, base path, `locales` block, sidebar.
  - `src/content.config.ts` — Content loader (`base: '../docs'`).
  - `src/pages/shared/0-prereqs.astro` — Full-HTML redirect forwarding the legacy `/shared/0-prereqs/` URL to the home page.
- **`AUTHORING.md`** — Author entry point (recipes for adding/editing content).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — PR flow + CI requirements.
- **`.github/`**
  - `copilot-instructions.md` + `instructions/*.md` — Authoring guidance for Copilot.
  - `agents/`, `skills/` — Custom agents and skills available to Copilot in this repo.
  - `workflows/pages.yml` — Builds and deploys the site on pushes to `main`.
